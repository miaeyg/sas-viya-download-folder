This project downloads a SAS Content folder to disk. Can be useful for git sync.

Code accepts as input a base folder and then downloads all .sas files (can be modified) in base folder and all subfolders recursively.

Thanks to this blog https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Go-Viya-First-steps-with-Go-language-and-SAS-Viya/ta-p/704659 for providing base code.
